# TrollMods
Collection of mods based on the [MacDirtyCow exploit](https://github.com/zhuowei/MacDirtyCowDemo/blob/main/vm_unaligned_copy_switch_race.c). No jailbreak is required for the tweaks and will work as long as the device version is between 15.0 and 16.1.2. Changes do not persist, meaning that a device reboot will revert all changes to stock.

# Why?
You may be wondering, why install this, when I can install the original tweaks from their original creators? While you can do that, it's important to note that regular users are limited to three sideloaded apps. TrollMods collects these tweaks into one app, allowing the user to sideload two other apps of their choice. :)
